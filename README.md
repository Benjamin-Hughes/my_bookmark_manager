# Bookmark manager

Makers Academy week 4 challenge - build a web app that stores web bookmarks in a database.

The app will be based on the following user stories:

```
As a User
So I can easily go to my favourite websites
I want to be able to see a list of links on the homepage

As a User
So I can save interesting websites
I want to be able to add a link to the bookmark list

As a User
So I can organise my bookmarks
I want to be able to add tags to links in the bookmark list

As a User
So I can find relevant bookmarks
I want to be able to filter links by a tag
```
